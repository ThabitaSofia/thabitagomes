GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) Field Survey:
Conducted a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey to locate possible water and power lines beneath a site at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. This project was carried out in collaboration with the university's infrastructure department as part of a preliminary site assessment before construction work began.
The processed data and interpretations are not publicly available.
