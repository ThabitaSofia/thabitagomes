## Projects

### Joint inversion of receiver functions and dispersion curves

As a part of a national grant to study the sedimentary basins in northern Brazil, in order to provide a better tectonic understanding of the on and offshore basins. I participated in this project by applying a joint inversion of teleseismic receiver functions and dispersion curves. Read more about it [here](joint_inversion.html)


### Development of the Herglotz-Wiechert algorithm in Python

I developed, in Python, a computational code to implement an inversion methodology based on the solution of the Herglotch-Wiechert algorithm and teste the performance of the method thorugh the measurement and inversion of P-wave travel times for a set of earthquakes recorded at the Brazilian Seismographic Network. Read more about it [here](./HW.html).

### Geophysical surveys
During my bachelor, I worked on several [geophysical surveys](./geophysical_surveys.html), with a range of purposes. See on the link some snapshots and objectives of these surveys.
