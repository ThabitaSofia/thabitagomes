## Introduction


## Bio

Geophysicist with a Masterâ€™s degree in Geophysics and Geodynamics, specializing in seismology and seismic data analysis. Strong research foundation in the application of joint inversion techniques for receiver functions and dispersion curves, particularly in studying sedimentary basins. My technical expertise includes seismological data processing, analysis, and interpretation, along with proficiency in Shell scripting, Unix-based operating systems and command-line tools. Iâ€™m also skilled in Python programming, with a focus on solving inverse geophysical problems. Passionate about bridging research and practical applications, I am proficient in tackling complex challenges and contributing to meaningful projects in geophysics.

## Projects

### Development of the Herglotz-Wiechert algorithm in Python

I developed, in Python, a computational code to implement an inversion methodology based on the solution of the Herglotch-Wiechert algorithm and teste the performance of the method thorugh the measurement and inversion of P-wave travel times for a set of earthquakes recorded at the Brazilian Seismographic Network. Read more about it [here](./HW.html).

### Geophysical surveys
During my bachelor, I worked on several [geophysical surveys](./geophysical_surveys.html), with a range of purposes. See on the link some snapshots and objectives of these surveys.

### Development of the Samba
As part of my Technical diploma, I developed a an algorithm in [Samba](./samba.html)
